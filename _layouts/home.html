  <h1>I'm Ian Goode, a digital product designer designer in Dublin, Ireland. <br> Currently Creative Director at Axonista.</h1>
  <p>I'm a designer and front-end developer with over five years professional experience, and still hungry to learn. I've designed and shipped award-winning multi-platform apps and an interactive video CMS used by innovative companies like QVC. I love to dive deep into the industries I work in, currently media & TV, learning what makes them tick. This blend of business, design, and technology means I operate best in small teams working closely together to build product.</p>
  <p>A full website is coming soon, in the meantime you can contact me via one of the places below. I'm always open to a conversation.</p>
